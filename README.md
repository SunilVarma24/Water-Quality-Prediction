# Water-Quality-Prediction
This project builds a Deep Learning-based multi-task model to predict Water Quality Index (WQI) (Regression) and Water Quality Classification (Classification) using the CPCB dataset. A single neural network is trained to predict both tasks simultaneously. The model achieves high accuracy and is evaluated using RÂ², Accuracy, and F1 Score.
